PowerBoard is an Open Source project for your Minecraft Server.
Normally you would need for everything like ranks, tablist and scoreboard an extra plugin. And these plugins aren't always so good and are missing some features like animations and are lacking of performance.
PowerBoard tries to put all these things into one plugin and to make these perfect.

It is already really powerful. But of course there are also always a few bugs. So feel free to join this project and contribute to it.

### Important news:<br>
This plugin is no longer in active development (but still maintained). Currently I won't make new feature, nor fix bugs. But everyone is welcome to continue developing the plugin and to make PRs.
I really hope that someone contributes, maybe I'll start do something myself again.
